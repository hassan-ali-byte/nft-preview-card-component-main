## ⚙️ My Process

### Built With

- ✅ **Semantic HTML5 markup** (`<article>`, `<header>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<time>`)
- 🎨 **CSS Custom Properties** for consistent theme colors
- 🧩 **CSS Flexbox & Grid** for layout alignment
- 🎬 **CSS transitions** for smooth hover fade effects
- 📐 **Responsive units** (`rem` , `em`)

---

## ✨ Highlights

- ♿ Used **semantic HTML** — added an `h1` (for screen readers) and `h2` (for the card title) to improve accessibility.
- 🎨 Implemented **hover** and **focus-visible** overlay effects with smooth fade transitions.
- ⌨️ Added **keyboard and mobile accessibility** support using `:focus` and `:focus-visible` for non-mouse users.
- 🪞 Enhanced visual feedback with **image scaling** and **blur effects** on hover and focus for modern UI interaction.
- ⚡ Applied **smooth transitions** using `transform` and `filter` for better user experience.
- 👁️‍🗨️ Practiced **accessibility best practices** like `.sr-only` for hidden headings and proper `alt` text.
